# Objects and Components Applied

This exercise is built to practice applying abstract classes to a real-world example

**Mandate**

1. You’re working on a project and you must refactor some classes into a  Component class in the code base that can be easily inherited, flexible and customizable without using a 3rd party tool (Angular/jQuery UI/ReactJS).
2. You’ve already created a button class so you must refactor it
3. You must create a card class
4. The component class now relies on a CSS file & HTML template, therefore rendering times will depend on load times, order must be respected!

**Instructions**

1. Fork this repository to create your own
2. Clone it to a work directory on your machine
3. Work on it and submit your work by simply pushing back to your forked repo

__Diagrams to be built together in class, good luck!__
